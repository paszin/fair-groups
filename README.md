# fair-groups
fair groups during the alterning home-schooling  / faire gruppen f√ºr den wechselunterricht

This tool enables schools to devide their classes in two equal groups.
The tool optimizes the courses to have almost equal sizes.

# Example

## Input

The input for this program is a csv-file with the columns course and pupils. The pupils are encoded as comma-separated list.

Example:
`pupils.csv`

```csv
course;pupils
course1;A,B,C,D,E,F
course2;A,B,C,G,H,I
course3;G,H,I,J,K,L
course4;A,G,I,D,E
```

## Output

```
Pupils in Group 1: ['A' 'C' 'F' 'I' 'K' 'L']
Pupils in Group 2: ['B' 'D' 'E' 'G' 'H' 'J']
Course and pupils per group
course1: 3 + 3
course2: 3 + 3
course3: 3 + 3
course4: 2 + 3
```
